# C# Automation
---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description:

This project focuses on automated UI testing for the DemoBlaze e-commerce platform using Selenium and C#. The tests simulate various user interactions such as user registration, login, adding products to the shopping cart, and completing purchases.
The code is organized in a modular structure with dedicated page classes, following the Page Object Model (POM) pattern. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability for future enhancements.
